# TCS CodeVita Season 13

This repository contains my Python solutions for problems solved during **TCS CodeVita Season 13 (Round 1)**.

### What this repo represents
- Practical problem-solving under time constraints  
- Logical thinking and edge-case handling  
- Clean and readable Python implementations  

Although I couldn’t clear Round 2, this experience helped me understand the competitive programming standard and areas where I need to improve.

I’m continuing to practice and will return stronger in future editions.
